Plugin 'othree/jspc.vim' "JavaScript Parameter Complete detects when you're inside a function argument and provides autocomplete suggestions (TernJS only adds existing symbols) So if you're writing an event listener, it'll suggest click and mouseover. You can see all the suggestions it provides in its GitHub source. On load, the jspc.vim plugin automatically detects whatever omnifunc you already have set as your default. It wraps it with the parameter completion, and falls back to your default if you are not in a parameter completion. Because of this you should specify jspc#omni instead of whatever your default completion is (typically javascriptcomplete#CompleteJS)
