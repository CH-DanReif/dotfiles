DOTFILES
========

Move along please.....nothing of interest here...

Followed https://github.com/michaeljsmalley/dotfiles

But I didn't like the way Michael took the dot out of the dotfiles. Self-description is always better than description by location, surely? A dotfile that's lost its dot is a sad thing indeed

TODO: Martin here is right: http://www.martin-burger.net/blog/unix-shell/manage-dotfiles-quickly-and-effortlessly/
The common-folder-and-symlink approach is mildly at odds with separation of concerns. If necessary, use a different approach.
